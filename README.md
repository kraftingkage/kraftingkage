# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kyle!
## I'm a young professional with a diverse programming experience.

Here you can find some of my school projects, personal projects, or repos that I may (or may not) have contributed to. I do my best to comment through my code, but if you're lost and need some assistance, please reach out to me.

Looking to collaborate? Lets talk. I'm Kyle!#2790 on Discord
